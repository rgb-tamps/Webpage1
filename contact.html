        <p> 
          Growing up, I was just an ordinary kid, lost in the immersive worlds of online games. I spent countless hours glued to my screen, my fingers dancing over the keyboard as I explored digital landscapes filled with excitement. While my friends were busy honing their skills in various activities, I felt stagnant, devoid of any real talent, especially in drawing. My childhood wasn't marked by artistic endeavors; instead, it was characterized by an obsession with video games that kept me entertained and distracted.
          <br><br>
          However, everything changed one fateful day when I stumbled upon an artist whose work captivated me. It wasn't just the beauty of the artwork that drew me in; it was the raw talent and skill displayed in each stroke that ignited a spark of jealousy within me. I wanted to create something beautiful too, something that would elicit the same feelings of awe that I felt gazing at that artist's creations. Fueled by this newfound desire, I picked up a pencil and began to draw, even though I didn't know the first thing about it.
          <br><br>       
          At first, my drawings were far from impressive. They were clumsy and rough, products of a novice who had only just begun to explore a new outlet for creativity. Despite the glaring imperfections, my friends remained supportive. They would often encourage me to draw, and to my surprise, they even offered to buy my artwork for a mere 3 or 5 pesos. While I was initially taken aback by their willingness to pay for my “ugly” drawings, I soon realized it was more than just the money that mattered. It was the validation, the acknowledgment that I was creating something that others appreciated, however small the amount may have been. It ignited a flicker of enthusiasm within me, a feeling that I had the potential to become an artist.
          <br><br>
          As I transitioned into high school, life relatively shifted. My passion for drawing began to wane, overshadowed by a growing laziness and lack of motivation. Once again, I drifted back into the comforting embrace of online games, neglecting my newly discovered talent. I spent two long years away from the canvas, feeling the weight of my unfulfilled ambition resting heavily on my shoulders while I lost myself in virtual realms.
          <br><br>
          Then, the world changed dramatically. The COVID-19 pandemic hit, forcing everyone into quarantine and changing the way we live and interact. I found myself in grade 9, isolated yet introspective. It was during this period of reflection that I encountered another talented artist online, someone whose unique art style spoke to me on a deeper level. I felt a resurgence of inspiration bubbling within me, urging me to pick up my pencil once more. This time, I found solace in drawing anime and cartoons, familiar styles that I could connect with and enjoy.
          <br><br>
          As I progressed into grade 10, I stumbled upon charcoal portraits. The depth and richness of black and white art resonated with me; it captured the intricacies of emotion in ways I had never seen before. Lucky for me, my favorite colors were black and white, so I was naturally drawn to the medium. I immersed myself in charcoal drawing, practicing diligently, even on days when I felt unmotivated or burned out. I learned that the journey of an artist is rarely smooth, and sometimes the best growth occurs during the challenging moments.
          <br><br>
          As the New Year of 2020 rolled around, an unexpected opportunity materialized. A friend of my mom’s admired my work and approached me with a request for a commissioned piece. Despite my lingering doubts about my abilities and the fear of disappointing her, I accepted the challenge. She was willing to pay $2,000 for my artwork—a staggering sum that filled me with both excitement and anxiety. I poured all my heart and soul into the commission, doing my best to create something beautiful. When she saw the finished piece, her joy and satisfaction were palpable. That moment became a significant turning point in my artistic journey; it was my first paid commission, a validation that my art could hold value beyond mere admiration from friends.
          <br><br>
          From that point on, my life as an artist transformed. I no longer viewed drawing as an occasional hobby but as a viable path. I began collaborating with others, taking on more commissions, and experimenting with different styles and mediums. While I had previously given away artwork to acquaintances for free, the shift in perspective opened doors to a flourishing side business. I committed myself to practice even more, pushing through the moments of self-doubt and adversity.
          <br><br>
          Today, I reflect on my journey with immense gratitude. What started as a simple desire to replicate the beauty I admired turned into a fulfilling passion that not only allowed me to express myself but also to earn money. The transformation from a game-addicted child with no artistic skills into a dedicated and passionate artist is nothing short of miraculous. I continuously strive to improve and refine my craft, knowing that every stroke of the pencil is a step further in my creative journey.
          <br><br>
          In retrospect, my love for drawing was always within me; I just needed the right encouragement to unleash it. Whether you’re an aspiring artist or simply someone wandering through life, never underestimate the power of hardwork and inspiration. You never know when a spark might ignite your passion and lead you down a path you never thought possible. Life’s twists and turns can bring unexpected gifts, and it's up to us to recognize, embrace, and nurture them as we grow.
